# 100DaysOfCode
Home base repo for my 100DaysOfCode challenge

Goals will evolve as I go...

1) utilize randomness whenever possible to make things more interesting
2) focus on intereactivity (UI and otherwise)
3) much of what I do will be about game dev, but I also want to expand my focus to general coding solutions as well.
4) planning to focus on what can be done with JS, HTML and CSS (w/ frameworks as needed)
5) need to style the Github pages site
  - add general styling
  - add "cards" for each project showing title, image, date added, tools used, etc
  - create a template for the project/test pages (not all will use it)

## DAY 1

- Github repo created & posted publically to Githu Pages at https://stipple3d.github.io/100Days/

- Structured repo to act as a portfolio site. Main page will be a landing page that links to the projects and test pages

- linked in 3 projects from my last month since starting again with JS. These will be refactored and modified as I go.
