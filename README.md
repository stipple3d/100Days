# 100DaysOfCode

Home base repo for my 100DaysOfCode challenge


Goals will evolve as I go...

So far: 

1) utilize randomness whenever possible to make things more interesting
2) focus on intereactivity (UI and otherwise)
3) much of what I do will be about game dev, but I also want to expand my focus to general coding solutions as well.
4) planning to focus on what can be done with js, html and css (and frameworks as needed)
5) have a Github Pages landing page with links to all the project pages and running tests.
