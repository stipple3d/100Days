# 100Days

Home base repo for my 100DaysOfCode challenge

Goals will evolve as I go...

so far, 

1) utilize randomness whenever possible to make things more interesting
2) focus on intereactivity (UI and otherwise)
3) much of what I do will be about game dev, but I also want to expand my focus to general coding solutions as well.
4) planning to focus on what can be done with js, html and css (and frameworks as needed)
